TravisTesting
=============

Once you've tried testing, you need to try to do something more interesting.  We want a Counter object with responsibilities  increment()  getValue() where the first adds one to the counter, and the second gives you back the current count. The constructor function should take no arguments, but set the initial count to zero. This requires a slightly different construction than we had before â€“ we need a variable in the scope of the function, but that is not a parameter.  So, specs:  As a developer, I expect that the counter value will be zero after the object is created. As a developer, I expect that the counter value after an increment() will be one more than before.  Add tests, and a http://TravisCI.org (Links to an external site.) badge to one of your repos' README that proves your tests pass.
